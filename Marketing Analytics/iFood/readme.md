## iFood CRM Data Analyst Case
iFood is the lead food delivery app in Brazil, present in over a thousand cities.
Keeping a high customer engagement is key for growing and consolidating the companyâ€™s
position as the market leader.

Data Analysts working within the data team are constantly challenged to provide insights and
value to the company through open scope projects. This case intends to simulate that.
In this case, you are presented a sample dataset, that mocks metainformation on the customer
and on iFood campaign interactions with that customer.

It is your challenge to understand the data, find business opportunities & insights and to propose
any data driven action to optimize the campaigns results & generate value to the company.
