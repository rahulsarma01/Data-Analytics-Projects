## Data Wrangling with Excel

Excel is a popular tool for working with data, allowing users to perform various data wrangling operations. This guide provides an introduction to some of the most commonly used functions and features for data wrangling with Excel, including conditional functions, pivot tables, XLOOKUP, VLOOKUP, and Flash Fill.


### Conditional Functions

Conditional functions allow users to perform calculations or operations based on specific conditions. Some of the most commonly used conditional functions include IF, COUNTIF, and SUMIF.

### Pivot Tables

Pivot tables are a powerful feature in Excel that allow users to summarize and analyze large amounts of data. A pivot table allows users to quickly group and summarize data in a flexible and customizable way.

### Flash Fill

Flash Fill is a powerful feature in Excel that allows you to quickly clean and format data in a flexible and intuitive way.

### VLOOKUP

The VLOOKUP function is used to search for a specific value in the first column of a table and return a corresponding value from another column in the same row. For example, if you have a table of employee information with names in the first column and salaries in the second column, you can use VLOOKUP to find the salary for a specific employee.

### XLOOKUP

XLOOKUP is an improved version of VLOOKUP that allows you to search for a value in any column of a table, not just the first column. This makes it much more flexible and easier to use in many cases. Additionally, XLOOKUP can perform exact matches, approximate matches, and search from the last value, whereas VLOOKUP only performs exact matches.
