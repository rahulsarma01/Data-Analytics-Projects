# Welcome to the Flipkart Product Review Sentiment Analysis project!

In this project, I aim to analyze the sentiment of product reviews on Flipkart, one of the largest e-commerce platforms in India. Flipkart offers a wide range of products, and the platform's success largely depends on the satisfaction of it's customers. Therefore, it is essential to understand the sentiment of customer reviews to improve the quality of products and services.
